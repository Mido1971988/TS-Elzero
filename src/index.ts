/*
difference between Statically typed language and Dynamically Typed Language: 

[1] Statically typed language > (Rust , C , C++)
    Variables Type are Static , once Declared you can not change it
    Do Type Checking at Compile-Time
    Better Performance at Run-Time because no need to check Types Dynamically (Error Detected earlier)

[2] Dynamically Typed Language > (PHP, Python, JS)
    Variable Type is Dynamic , you can change it any time
    Type Checking at Excution-Time (Error can be detected after Excution)
*/

// let num = 10;
// num = "Elzero" // Error Type 'String' is not assignable to type 'number'

// let age = 40;
// if(age > 30) {
//     console.log("Good")
// }else{
//     // repeat is string method not number method
//     // will detect the Error before run the Code and even if age > 30 and will not excute this line of code
//     console.log(age.repeat(3)) 
// }
